# Property Evaluator

My first flutter project, is about rating the property

Currently only develop for IOS

## Features to add
- Sorting logic, and secondary sort
- import and export csv
- Real estate link to property
- Support different currency
- Make cost support decimal place
- Polish info message and warning message
- save theme info to shared_preference
- Animation:
  - Bottom sheet appearing
  - Removing item
  - Radio button on the home page annotation

## Refactoring & Tech debt
- Better way to manage state
- Add tests to the entire project
- Refactor using closure to avoid arguments used multiple time
- Linting
- Fix Theming using flex_color_scheme

## Run linting
`dart fix --dry-run`
`dart fix --apply`
